                    <td>This recipe was OVERLY too sweet. I would start out with 1/3 or 1/4 cup of sugar and just add on from there. Just 2 cups was way too much and I had to go back to the grocery store to buy more raspberries because it made so much mix. Overall, I would buy the long narrow box of raspberries. It's a perfect fit for the recipe plus a little extra. I was not impressed with this recipe. It was exceptionally over-sweet. If you make this simple recipe, MAKE SURE TO ADD LESS SUGAR!</td>
