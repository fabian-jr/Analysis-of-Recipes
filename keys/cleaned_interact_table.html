We usually love cumin, but didn't notice the missing 1/2 teaspoon!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|     126440 |       85009 | 2010-02-27 |        5 | I made the Mexican topping and took it to bunko.  Everyone loved it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Yum!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2000192946 |      120345 | 2015-05-10 |        2 | This recipe was OVERLY too sweet.  I would start out with 1/3 or 1/4 cup of sugar and jsut add on from there.  Just 2 cups was way too much and I had to go back to the grocery store to buy more raspberries because it made so much mix.  Overall, I would but the long narrow box or raspberries.  Its a perfect fit for the recipe plus a little extra.  I was not impressed with this recipe.  It was exceptionally over-sweet.  If you make this simple recipe, MAKE SURE TO ADD LESS SUGAR! |
|     255338 |      134728 | 2008-04-11 |        5 | First time using liquid smoke in a recipe. Made this as directed. My kids enjoyed this, so we will make this again. Thank you for posting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
